# Bluetooth Low Energy with Android and Arduino: 

## Chapter 6: Services and Characteristics


These are **complete downloadable code examples** from my book, _Bluetooth Low Energy with iOS Swift_.  The book teaches how to make Bluetooth Low Energy devices using iOS/Swift.  

This chapter teaches:
* Central: Inspect the GATT Services of a connected Peripheral
* Peripheral: Hosting a GATT Profile
